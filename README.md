# OT2-items-nuts-99
For Octopath Traveler II

Item DB Source: (These ids are the same as the in-game files)
https://octopathtraveler.fandom.com/wiki/Module:Inventory/data_OT2

Uses Python to hex-edit your save to set all the nuts in your inventory to 99. This only works if you already have one nut already in your inventory, as otherwise it will not be found in your save file.

For reference, the nut ids make up the int ids '1950' to '1979'.

Should be able to work for some other inventory items, just change the year_value check to be the number int ids you want intstead.
